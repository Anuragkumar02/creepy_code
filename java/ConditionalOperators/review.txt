Conditional operators work on boolean values to simplify our code. Theyâ€™re often combined with conditional statements to consolidate the branching logic.

Conditional-AND, &&, evaluates to true if the booleans on both sides are true.

if (true && false) {
  System.out.println("You won't see me print!");
} else if (true && true) {
  System.out.println("You will see me print!");
}
Conditional-OR, ||, evaluates to true if one or both of the booleans on either side is true.

if (false || false) {
  System.out.println("You won't see me print!");
} else if (false || true) {
  System.out.println("You will see me print!");
}
Logical-NOT, !, evaluates to the opposite boolean value to which it is applied.

if (!false) {
  System.out.println("You will see me print!");
}
Instructions
The complete Reservation class is in the code editor.

Play around inside main() and see if you can create instances that will run every possible conditional branch.
