Compilation: Creating Executables
Compilation helped us catch an error. Now that we’ve corrected the file, let’s walk through a successful compilation.

As a reminder, we can compile a .java file from the terminal with the command:

javac Whales.java
If the file compiles successfully, this command produces an executable class: FileName.class. Executable means we can run this program from the terminal.

We run the executable with the command:

java Whales
Note that we leave off the .class part of the filename.

Here’s a full compilation cycle as an example:

// within the file: Welcome.java
public class Welcome {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Welcome to Codecademy's Java course!");
  }
}
We have one file: Welcome.java. We compile with the command:

javac Welcome.java
The terminal shows no errors, which indicates a successful compilation.
